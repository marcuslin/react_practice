## Step 1: Install node
Skip this part if you already installed node.
If not visit [this page](https://changelog.com/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x/) and follow the instructions.

**NOTE:** You might need to install **homebrew** as well.

## Step 2: Install gulp globally
Type this command in your terminal ```sudo npm install gulp -g```

## Step 3: Install all needed plugins for gulp
There's a bunch of stuff we required in **gulpfile.js**, so we need to
install them by running ```npm install``` in our terminal.

The list of the plugins we're using are inside **package.json**.
## Step 4: Start up localhost
After installing, go to your terminal and type in **gulp**,
 it'll start up a local server for you.

After doing all the steps above,
 visit [this repo](https://github.com/marcuslin/react_practice_server) to get server's code.
